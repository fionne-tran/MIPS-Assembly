# MIPS-Assembly
[CS 2340] Computer Architecture

This repository contains .asm files of MIPS assembly code that were developed in the MARS MIPS simulator for Computer Architecture assignents.

1 - MIPS Operations

This .asm file of MIPS assembly code conducts mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, mulitplication, and division) with integers from user input.

2 - MIPS Read File

This .asm file of MIPS assembly code reads a user input file and counts the amount of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, number symbols, other symbols, lines of text, and signed numbers.
